Mobile AI Hackathon: Cactus X Nothing X Hugging Face

About
We invite the best Flutter, React Native, and Kotlin developers to the **Mobile Agent Hackathon**. Build the future of local, private and personal AI with us.

Cloud AI is powerful, but the future belongs to the Edge. Your challenge is to build a mobile application that leverages **on-device AI** to solve real user problems. We aren't just looking for wrappers. We want apps that utilize local inference to achieve:

- **Total Privacy:** Data that never leaves the device.
- **Zero Latency:** Real-time interactions (voice, gaming, UI).
- **Offline Capability:** Intelligence that works anywhere.

**Audience:** Mobile and AI devs

You will be building with **Cactus** (YC S25), a new open-source framework for high-performance edge inference.

- **Framework:** Cactus SDK (Supports React Native, Flutter, Kotlin, C++)
- **Models:** Push the limits of edge hardware with
    - **Liquid Foundation Models** (text, vision, tool calling)
    - **Smol** (text, vision)
    - **Qwen3** (text, tool calling, embedding)
    - ...and many other models!

See Quickstart for more details on getting started

- **Theme & Tracks**
    - **Main Track:** Best Mobile Application with On-Device AI.
    - **Track 1**: *The Memory Master.* Best implementation of a shared memory/knowledge base for local LLMs.
    - **Track 2**: *The Hybrid Hero.* Best execution of a local <> cloud hybrid inference strategy (router pattern).

- **Evaluation Criteria**
    
    Successful submissions must:
    
    - Use the Cactus SDK
    - Demonstrate functional AI features running locally.
    - Ship a usable .apk/.ipa or TestFlight link.

- **Evaluation criteria**
    
    The submissions will be evaluated across the following criteria (0-10 each)
    
    - **Technical Implementation:** Deep integration of the **Cactus SDK** to run models locally. Pure API wrappers that rely solely on the cloud will be disqualified.
    - **Edge Capabilities:** Demonstration of true edge advantages: **Offline Capability** (works without internet), **Zero Latency** (real-time interaction), and **Total Privacy** (data stays on-device).
    - **Design & UX:** A polished, intuitive mobile interface. We value high-quality UX that demonstrates the fluidity and responsiveness of running AI on-device.
    - **Utility & Innovation:** The solution must solve a real user problem. We are looking for novel functionality, not just a chat interface.
    - **Completeness:** Submission of a functional, testable build (** .apk, .ipa, or TestFlight link**) by the deadline.
